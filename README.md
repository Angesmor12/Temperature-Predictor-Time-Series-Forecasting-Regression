# Temperature Predictor ( Time Series Forecasting/Regression )

Artificial Intelligence Project Focused on Time Series Models

This project presents a time series forecasting model designed to predict the mean temperature of Delhi, India, at 3-hour intervals.
The model use advanced machine learning techniques and ensemble methods to analyze historical weather data and make accurate mean temperature predictions.
The dataset used for training encompasses detailed weather information from the city of Delhi spanning the years 2013 to 2017. This repository provides a comprehensive overview of the workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering for time series, model training, and the evaluation of the most effective forecasting models.
